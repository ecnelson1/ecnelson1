Welcome to my Repo!

Im Eion (He/Him) and I am a software developer, a pool player, and a lover of all things live music related!

My core skill sets are in software development and operations management. 

I have always been a person to try and give a hand up, not out, and Iâ€™m looking to write web and mobile apps focused on helping the average person find resources to help them improve a job skill, or apply for programs that can help get educational funding and match them with a training program that will help improve their quality of life.

The thing that makes me such a valuable member of a team is my adaptability, 
even before my time in the Marines I was a person who has always had to "do more with less,"
and bringing that capability and can do attitude to a team or project with the right resources is not only my goal, but my driving motivation.

Please, reach out and let me know if there is a project you are passionate about that could use a driven, goal oriented developer!
